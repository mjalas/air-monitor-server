# Air monitor server #

The application stores and displays air monitoring sensor data. Data is sent to the server through HTTP POST requests, and the data can be viewed through HTTP GET requests. 

ATTENTION: The application is in very early stages, so it should not be used in production as is. More info coming soon!
